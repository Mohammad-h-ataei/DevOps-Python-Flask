## Project Overview

This project provides a DevOps-focused Python Flask web application with automation and deployment best practices. It is designed to demonstrate DevOps principles in a Python application environment, showcasing infrastructure automation, containerization, and CI/CD pipeline setup for reliable deployments.

## Features

- **Flask Web Application**: A basic Python Flask web server that can be extended with custom routes and functionality.
- **Containerization**: Docker setup for containerized deployment of the application.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Scripts and configurations to automate infrastructure setup and management.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker**
- **Git**
- Any additional tools for CI/CD setup (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar if applicable)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-h-ataei/DevOps-Python-Flask.git
cd DevOps-Python-Flask
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application Locally

The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

5. Docker Setup
Build and run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t devops-python-flask .
docker run -p 5000:5000 devops-python-flask
Deployment
This project includes configurations to deploy on a cloud environment or as a containerized application.

CI/CD Pipeline
Configure the .github/workflows files (or other CI/CD pipeline files) to automate testing and deployment.
Define environment-specific configurations (e.g., production, staging) for streamlined deployment.
